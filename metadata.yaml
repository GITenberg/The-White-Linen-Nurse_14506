description: Rae Malgregor went into the profession of nursing with the best of intentions,
  but she soon finds that her expectations were vastly different than the reality
  of her new job. Burnt out and mired in despair, she begs for intervention and soon
  finds herself caring for a young invalid girl. Before long, her life begins to change
  in ways she never could have imagined. The White Linen Nurse is a hilariously engaging
  tale that will charm modern-day readers.
